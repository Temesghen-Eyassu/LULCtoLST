# LULCtoLST

This package is designed to show the relationship between the dynamics of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and their impact on Land Surface Temperature (LST) changes or differences. It is created using R version 4.4.2.

## Description

The package begins by classifying LULC types using Landsat 8 imagery from two selected years: 2014 and 2024, based on the Random Forest Algorithm. The classification categorizes the LULC into five distinct classes:
- Built-Up Areas
- Water Bodies
- Agricultural Areas
- Natural Vegetation
- Open Areas

The project then analyzes the changes in LULC over time between these two years. Additionally, the LST will be derived using Landsat 8â€™s thermal band (Band 10) for both 2014 and 2024. An analysis of the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST for these years will be performed. This will include calculating the correlation and conducting regression analysis to explore how vegetation cover (indicated by NDVI) relates to variations in LST. Furthermore, the project will examine the relationship between changes in LULC and differences in LST between the two years, providing insights into how land use and Land Use and Land Cover changes impact Land Surface Temperature trends.

## Installation

To install the **LULCtoLST** package, use the following steps:

1. **Install the devtools package** (if not already installed):

    ```r
    install.packages("devtools")
    ```

2. **Install the LULCtoLST package from GitHub**:

    ```r
    library(devtools)
    install_github("Temesghen-Eyassu/LULCtoLST")
    ```

3. **Load the package**:

    ```r
    library(LULCtoLST)
    ```

### **LULC and LST Comparison for 2014 and 2024**

#### Cropped Images
The Landsat 8 dataset was downloaded from the official Earth Observation USGS website, where users are required to create an account to gain access and download the data. I cropped Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 using the shapefile of Asmara, the capital city of Eritrea. Here is the cropped images for the year 2014 and 2024.

#### Masked Images
The cropped images were then masked with the shapefile of the study area.

#### Classified Images
These masked images were classified using the Random Forest Algorithm, based on the training data. QGIS 3.40 was used to create the training data for both years.

Finally, the LULCtoLST package can be used in any selected study area, especially with Landsat datasets. I have tested it in another study area, and it worked well.
