Description: This package is designed to classify land use and land cover (LULC) types using Landsat 8 imagery from two selected years. 
             The classification will categorize the land cover into distinct classes (such as Built_UP_Areas, Water_Bodies, Natural_Vegetation etc.) 
             and analyze the changes in land cover over time. Additionally, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) for the same two years will be 
             derived using Landsat 8's thermal band (Band 10). The project further includes an analysis of the relationship between 
             Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST for the selected years. 
             This will be accomplished by calculating the correlation and performing regression analysis to understand 
             how vegetation cover (as indicated by NDVI) is related to surface temperature variations across the two years.
